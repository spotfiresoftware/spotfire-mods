## How to use a snippet

Each snippet listed below contains three code blocks. The first block shows the command to run to add the script with an ID and a name. For example `npx @spotfire/mods-sdk add-script my-snippet-id --name my-snippet-name`.
The second block shows the expected entry in the `scripts` array of the mod manifest. The third block shows the source code of the script.
Test the snippet by adding the entry to your mod manifest, then copy and paste the source code into the script file.
Some snippets use APIs which require your mod to declare additional capabilities.
