# Spotfire Mods prototypes

This folder contains prototypes and smaller demos. Please feel free to use these demos as inspiration and a place to learn concepts of the Mods API. 

**Note:** Please use projects from the [`examples`](../examples) folder when starting a new mod project. The examples projects are structured to be starting points in a way these prototypes are not.

Some of these prototypes are featured on the [TIBCO Spotfire Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TibcoSpotfire).
